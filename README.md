# How it works:
Influencers register an account by listing their social media accounts, interests, and basic information. By promoting brands through native advertising on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, influencers earn money based off of CPMs (cost per thousand impressions), which are determined by the company you are connected with.

Advertising requests are two way, so both companies and influencers can reach out if they see a connection they have interest in. Simply select the profile, whether company or influencer, and begin the connection!
